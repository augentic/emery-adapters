## Rule

Documentation in this repository cites the `specify` CLI constantly — command lines in fenced `bash` blocks, verbs and flags in inline code, journal event ids, and the kebab-case `error` discriminants skills branch on. Every one of those citations is a contract claim, and until now nothing checked them: a renamed verb, a retired flag, or a reworded event id left stale prose behind with no failing check.

This rule closes that seam. The running binary injects its own machine-readable contract — the same payload `specify contract dump` emits: the clap verb tree with per-verb flags, the journal event-id taxonomy, and the wire-stable error discriminants — and the `cli-contract` hint kind checks the documentation against it:

- **`invocations`** — every `specify …` command line found in `bash` / `sh` fences or inline code is walked down the verb tree. A kebab token where a subcommand is required but not declared, or a `--flag` the resolved verb (and its ancestors) does not accept, is a finding. Positionals, placeholders (`<slice>`, `$VAR`), and everything after a literal `--` are skipped.
- **`event-ids`** — dotted-kebab inline code spans (e.g. a journal event id cited in prose) and `"event"` field values in fenced JSON must be event ids the binary declares. File names are exempted via the `ignore-suffixes` policy; YAML field paths that are not event ids belong in `ignore`.
- **`error-codes`** — kebab-case `"error"` field values in fenced JSON examples must be error discriminants the binary declares.

Named-test citations (`tests/….rs` claims against the binary's build-time test inventory) are the fourth selector of the same kind, scoped separately by [CORE-060](CORE-060-cli-test-citation-drift.md) — adapter references legitimately describe downstream generated-crate `tests/` layouts that are not CLI tests.

Because the contract is rebuilt from the binary on every `make lint` run, bumping the CLI pin re-checks every citation in the same change — the rename sweep `engine/AGENTS.md` rule 5 prescribes is now machine-enforced on this side.

## Look For

- A fenced `bash` example invoking a verb that was renamed or never shipped.
- An inline `specify … --flag` citation where the flag was retired.
- Prose citing a journal event id that no longer exists in the closed taxonomy.
- A fenced JSON envelope example carrying an `error` discriminant the binary never emits.

## Fix

Align the citation with the live CLI surface: run `specify contract dump --format json` (or `specify <verb> --help`) to see the declared verbs, flags, event ids, and error discriminants, and rewrite the stale citation. If the citation is intentionally illustrative — a deliberately hypothetical verb or a YAML dotted path that resembles an event id — add the offending token to the rule's `ignore` / `ignore-suffixes` config rather than weakening the prose.
