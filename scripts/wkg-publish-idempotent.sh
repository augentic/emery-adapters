# Idempotent wasm-pkg publish leg: probe, then (optionally
# build, then) publish.
#
# Usage: wkg-publish-idempotent.sh <package-ref> <artifact-path> [build-command...]
#
# Probes the registry for <package-ref> FIRST; only when the identity is
# definitively absent does it run the optional [build-command...] and
# `wkg publish` <artifact-path>. In this repo every component is
# release-built up front by `cargo make build-guests-release`, so the
# publish loop omits the build command. Registry identities are
# immutable, and skip-if-present is the immutability enforcement
# (DECISIONS.md §"Idempotent adapter publishing on GITHUB_TOKEN"): it is
# what prevents a re-tag from mutating an already-published version.
#
# The load-bearing invariant is the absent-vs-unreachable distinction:
# the probe treats only a definitive not-found as permission to publish.
# Any other probe failure (network unreachable, auth, timeout, missing
# namespace mapping) aborts the leg non-zero — guessing "absent" on an
# unreachable registry would re-push into an immutable identity.
#
# Requirements:
#   - `wkg` on PATH (CI pins `cargo install wkg@0.15.0 --locked`: the
#     not-found fingerprints below are coupled to wkg's error text and
#     were validated against 0.15.0 — revalidate them when bumping)
#   - a wasm-pkg config mapping the package's namespace to its registry
#     host (CI writes one; see .github/workflows/release.yaml)
#
# A sibling copy of this script lives in the specify engine repo
# (scripts/wkg-publish-idempotent.sh); the probe/fingerprint/abort logic
# must stay semantically identical — apply fixes to both.
