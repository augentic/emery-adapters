# `documentation.extract`

For one `Lead`, walk `$SOURCE_DIR` (read-only) and return a single `Evidence` document of structured claims. The CLI persists the result at `.specify/slices/<slice>/evidence/<source>.yaml`; this prompt returns the YAML body only. Core synthesis later reconciles this Evidence with every other bound source's into the slice's `spec.md` — see [From sources to slices](../references/spec-runtime/reconciliation.md#slice-time-evidence-becomes-a-spec).

## Inputs

- `$SOURCE_DIR` — read-only preopen of the bound docs path.
- `<source>` — the plan-level binding key under `plan.yaml.sources.<key>`.
- `<lead>` — the lead from `discovery.md` this run is extracting Evidence for.
- `$SCRATCH_DIR` — per-slice write-only scratch space; use only for unavoidable intermediate state.

## Locate the lead's docs

The lead id was produced by `documentation.survey` from a top-heading (or a logical section in a monolithic file). Resolve it back:

1. Prefer the file whose top H1 slugs to `<lead>`.
2. Fall back to the file whose kebab-cased stem equals `<lead>`.
3. In a monolithic file, anchor to the section whose H1 (or top-most heading) slugs to `<lead>`.

If no doc resolves, return Evidence with `claims: []` rather than fabricating content. The CLI treats empty `claims:` as valid; an unresolvable lead becomes a `Status: unknown` requirement during synthesis.

## Claim kinds

Closed for this adapter:

| Kind | Required body field | When to emit |
|---|---|---|
| `requirement` | `statement` | A behavioural claim the docs state about the system (one sentence, present tense). |
| `criterion` | `criterion` | An acceptance criterion the docs list (often under "Acceptance:" or a bullet list under a requirement). |
| `decision` | `decision` | A design or product decision the docs record (often "Decision:" lines or paragraphs). |
| `section` | (free-form) | A bounded prose section worth carrying into synthesis verbatim when no finer-grained claim fits. |

`id` is **required** on `requirement` and `criterion` kinds (deterministic reconciliation at synthesis time keys off it). `id` is **optional** on `decision` and `section`. Other claim kinds in `schemas/evidence.schema.json` are out of scope for this adapter.

## `path` grammar

Every claim carries a `path` rooted relative to `$SOURCE_DIR`. The grammar matches GitHub-style anchors:

- `<path>` — whole-file claim.
- `<path>#L<n>` — single line.
- `<path>#L<start>-L<end>` — line range.

Line numbers are 1-indexed against the file at extract time. Choose the tightest anchor that bounds the cited text.

## Output

Return one Evidence document matching `schemas/evidence.schema.json`. Field order is fixed (`authority`, `lead`, `claims`).

```yaml
authority: documentation
lead: <lead>
claims:
  - kind: requirement
    id: <kebab-or-dotted-id>
    path: <relative-path>#L<n>
    statement: "..."
  - kind: criterion
    id: <kebab-or-dotted-id>
    path: <relative-path>#L<n>
    criterion: "..."
  - kind: decision
    path: <relative-path>#L<n>
    decision: "..."
```

`authority` is always the literal `documentation` (operator-provided written product/technical intent; the authority precedence `intent > documentation > behaviour` is defined in [`authority.md`](../references/spec-runtime/synthesis/authority.md)). `lead` is the supplied `<lead>`. The document's `(slice, source)` identity is path-borne (the CLI persists it at `.specify/slices/<slice>/evidence/<source>.yaml`) and the adapter resolves from `plan.yaml.sources.<source>.adapter`, so neither is written in-document.

## Worked example

Input (`password-reset.md` in `$SOURCE_DIR`):

```markdown
# Password reset

The account service should let a registered user request a password reset link by email.

Acceptance:
- Unknown email addresses receive the same outward response as known users.
- Reset links expire after 30 minutes.

Decision: use the existing transactional email provider rather than introducing a new notification service.
```

Output (Evidence for `lead: password-reset`, bound under `source: product-notes`, persisted at `evidence/product-notes.yaml`):

```yaml
authority: documentation
lead: password-reset
claims:
  - kind: requirement
    id: password-reset.request
    path: password-reset.md#L3
    statement: "The account service should let a registered user request a password reset link by email."
  - kind: criterion
    id: password-reset.response-privacy
    path: password-reset.md#L6
    criterion: "Unknown email addresses receive the same outward response as known users."
  - kind: criterion
    id: password-reset.expiry
    path: password-reset.md#L7
    criterion: "Reset links expire after 30 minutes."
  - kind: decision
    path: password-reset.md#L9
    decision: "Use the existing transactional email provider rather than introducing a new notification service."
```

## Determinism

- Emit claims in source order (top of file to bottom). Stable order keeps synthesis golden runs reproducible.
- Quote statements / criteria / decisions verbatim from the docs where possible. Light grammatical normalisation (capitalisation, terminal punctuation) is allowed; rephrasing is not.
- Do not invent `id`s. Derive them from the lead id plus a short noun phrase the docs use (`password-reset.expiry`, not `req-007`).

## Guardrails

- `$SOURCE_DIR` is read-only. Reads outside it surface as `source-extract-path-denied`; never attempt to widen the preopen.
- Never write Evidence to disk yourself — return the YAML body to the CLI, which persists it under `.specify/slices/<slice>/evidence/<source>.yaml`.
- Never emit closed-enum kinds outside `{requirement, criterion, decision, section}` from this adapter. Spatial kinds (`region`/`container`/`leaf`) belong to `screenshots`; behaviour kinds (`excerpt`/`type`/`call`) belong to code source adapters.
- Never omit `id` on `requirement` or `criterion`. The CLI validates Evidence against `schemas/evidence.schema.json` before synthesis; a missing `id` fails the slice in `refining`.
- Empty `claims: []` is valid output when a lead cannot be resolved to any doc content. Do not pad with speculative claims.
