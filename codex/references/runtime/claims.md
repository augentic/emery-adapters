# Claim ids, anchors, and the fail-closed gate

The three rules every extract answer is checked against before the engine reads it. Adapter prompts link this document and keep only their own kind table and worked examples; the SDK's answer tail and the engine's load gate both enforce exactly what is written here.

## `id` grammar

An `id` is dotted-kebab: one or more segments joined by `.`, each segment lowercase ASCII letters and digits joined by `-`.

```text
^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*(\.[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*)*$
```

- `password-reset.expiry`, `session.timeout`, `user-list.search-filter` are valid; `Not.Valid`, `req-007`, `session_timeout`, and a trailing `.` are not.
- `id` is **required** on `requirement`, `criterion`, and `example` claims — deterministic reconciliation keys off it. It is optional on every other kind; carry it there only when the claim backs a specific requirement.
- Derive ids from the domain concept the claim describes, using the source's own noun phrases — never from file names, heading positions, line numbers, or invented counters. Byte-equal ids across sources always merge into one requirement ([reconciliation.md](reconciliation.md)).
- A `criterion` id must equal its requirement's id or extend it with a dotted suffix (`password-reset.expiry` or `password-reset.expiry.window`). A criterion with an unrelated id leaves its requirement uncovered, and an uncovered requirement renders as an `[unknown]` acceptance gap.

## `path` anchors

Every claim mined from a `$SOURCE_DIR` tree carries a `path` rooted relative to `$SOURCE_DIR`; claims from an inline value omit it. The grammar matches GitHub-style anchors:

- `<path>` — whole-file claim.
- `<path>#L<n>` — single line.
- `<path>#L<start>-L<end>` — line range.

Line numbers are 1-indexed against the file at extract time. The path is relative (no leading `/`, no `..`) and never under a skip root. Choose the tightest anchor that bounds the cited text: the anchor is the citation, the body field carries short context, and stable spans at named boundaries keep re-runs byte-stable.

## Skip roots

The engine's own files live in the project the sources are bound from, and they are output, never input. Every adapter skips them wherever they appear under `$SOURCE_DIR` — never read them, never anchor a claim in them:

- `spec.md` and `design.md` — the Markdown projections of the current revision, rendered by `emery show`.
- `.emery/` — the carried revision pair (`spec.json`, `design.json`) the next `emery specify` continues from.
- `.omnia/` — the runtime's storage root (the revision store) and any cache trees under it.

Mining a projection back into claims would make the engine's last answer look like evidence for its next one, and every requirement it re-derived that way would read as `agreed` with itself. Adapter prompts add their own language- or format-specific skip roots (`node_modules`, `target`, test trees, …) beside this list, never instead of it.

## The fail-closed gate

- Required body fields are a closed table: `requirement` → `statement`, `criterion` → `criterion`, `example` → `replay-digest`. A claim missing its required field, or carrying an `id` outside the grammar, fails the **whole run** closed as a typed `bad_request` naming the source, claim, and key. There is no partial acceptance and no fallback to `synopsis`.
- The caller checks the answer first: a failing answer is returned with the findings and a bounded number of repairs is asked for. Correct the named claims; do not drop them.
- `claims: []` is valid output when the source genuinely has nothing to say. Never pad with speculative claims — the engine preserves gaps as `[unknown]` rather than guessing.
- Never write Evidence to disk; return the JSON body and the caller persists it.
