# Shared spec runtime bundle

This directory is the single **spec-runtime bundle**: a tree of relative symlinks pointing at the canonical references under `plugins/spec/references/`. Each source and target adapter exposes it as `references/spec-runtime/` via a single directory symlink (`adapters/{sources,targets}/<name>/references/spec-runtime -> ../../../codex/references/runtime`), so adapter prompts can link with `../references/spec-runtime/...` without escaping the adapter tree. `specify init` dereferences the symlinks when it vendors the bundle into each cached adapter, so consumer projects receive self-contained regular files.

There are no generated copies and no sync step: a symlink can never drift from its target. Edit the canonical file under `plugins/spec/references/` and every adapter sees the change immediately.

**Maintainer note (specify-adapters fork):** this repository carries a **forked copy** of the spec-runtime bundle as regular files under `codex/references/runtime/`, not live symlinks into `augentic/specify`. When `plugins/spec/references/` changes in specify, manually sync the matching files here (or run `make check-adapters-parity` from a sibling specify checkout).

Top-level symlinks use four `../` segments; `cli/` and `synthesis/` entries use five (they sit one level deeper).

## Editing rules

- Edit the canonical file under `plugins/spec/references/`. Never replace a bundle entry with a regular-file copy, and never replace an adapter's `references/spec-runtime` symlink with a directory of copies — CI's "Verify spec-runtime symlinks resolve" step fails on either regression.
- Adding a new shared reference: drop the canonical file under `plugins/spec/references/`, then add one symlink here. Every adapter inherits it through its directory symlink automatically.
- Do not add agent-critical prose only under `docs/`; the spec-runtime bundle resolves into `plugins/spec/references/`, which is the surface the Cursor plugin cache and `specify init` ship.

## Review-team protocol

The review-team protocol is a separate surface and is **not** part of the spec-runtime bundle above (it resolves into `docs/`, not `plugins/spec/references/`). It is exposed here as a single overlay symlink, `review-team-protocol.md -> ../../../../docs/reference/review-team-protocol.md`, and each target adapter exposes it as `references/agent-teams.md -> ../../../codex/references/runtime/review-team-protocol.md`. Overlays MUST be symlinks (regular-file copies are forbidden); `CORE-011` guards the canonical document's presence and CI's symlink check verifies every overlay resolves to it.
