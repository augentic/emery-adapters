# JSON Schema — Author

> **When to read this.** Read this when authoring or extending standalone JSON Schema documents under `contracts/schemas/` for a Emery change — i.e. when the contracts adapter build prompt during the build phase selects the author intent for shared payload vocabulary, or when an operator extends the baseline for new payload types referenced (or about to be referenced) by the `openapi` or `asyncapi` sub-flows. Skip this file when importing external schema files (use [`importer.md`](./importer.md)) or when verifying existing artefacts (use [`verifier.md`](./verifier.md)).

## Inputs

```text
$SLICE_DIR     = .emery/slices/<slice-name>
$SPECS_DIR      = $SLICE_DIR/specs
$CONTRACTS_DIR  = $SLICE_DIR/contracts
$SCHEMAS_DIR    = $CONTRACTS_DIR/schemas
$BASELINE_DIR   = contracts
```

## Authority hierarchy

When sources conflict, follow this strict precedence:

1. **This file** — author rules and hard constraints for JSON Schema documents.
2. **Emery artefacts** (specs) — behavioural requirements drive the field shape.
3. **Format conventions** — [`../../references/json-schema-conventions.md`](../../references/json-schema-conventions.md).
4. **Baseline schemas** (`contracts/schemas/`) — existing platform vocabulary; never overwrite silently.
5. **LLM inference** — prohibited for unknowns; mark with `[unknown]` and surface in the alignment report.

If specs and baseline disagree on a shape (e.g. the spec asserts a `verified_at` field that the baseline `User` schema omits), surface the mismatch in the alignment report's Warnings section. Never silently overwrite baseline schemas — a human reviewer decides whether to extend the existing schema or fork a new `$id`.

## Ownership note

Per the cross-format ordering rule in `contracts.build`, this sub-flow **owns** all decisions about JSON Schema files. The `openapi` and `asyncapi` sub-flows only `$ref` into `contracts/schemas/`; they never inline or restructure schema files. When an OpenAPI or AsyncAPI path realises a payload type is missing or under-specified, it must route the schema work back here before continuing — never inline a workaround.

This skill therefore runs **before** the protocol skills in any mixed-format change. The author algorithm assumes the protocol skills will pick up `$ref` pointers later; it does not need to coordinate with them mid-run.

## The 4-step author algorithm

The author runs four sequential steps end-to-end whenever the contracts adapter build prompt asks for shared payload coverage. Each step is a focused, independently-checkable phase; downstream steps assume the upstream output is well-formed.

### Step 1 — Read the baseline

Build an inventory of `$BASELINE_DIR/schemas/`:

| Source | Extract |
|---|---|
| `schemas/*.yaml` | `$id`, `title`, `description`, `type`, `properties` (names + types + formats), `required` array, `$ref` targets, `$defs`, `additionalProperties` policy |

For each baseline schema, record:

- **Identity** — `$id` (URN) plus filename.
- **Shape** — property names, types, formats, required-ness, nested `$ref` targets, file-local `$defs`.
- **Consumers** — which baseline files in `$BASELINE_DIR/http/` and `$BASELINE_DIR/messages/` reference the schema via `$ref: "../schemas/<name>.yaml"`. Knowing this is a precondition for the alignment report's compatibility section.

When `$BASELINE_DIR/schemas/` is empty or absent, the baseline is empty — every spec-derived type becomes delta. Record an empty inventory and proceed.

### Step 2 — Identify payload types from the specs

Read every `*.md` file under `$SPECS_DIR/` and harvest payload-shaped requirements. A spec scenario maps to a JSON Schema file when it describes:

- A named entity referenced as a request body, response body, or message payload (`UserRegistration`, `Order`, `OAuthToken`, `ErrorResponse`).
- A reusable sub-shape used across multiple operations or channels (`Address`, `Money`, `Pagination`).
- A platform-wide vocabulary type that appears across contract formats (`ErrorResponse`, `ResourceLink`).

Build a structured list of **spec-derived types**, one entry per named type:

```text
- type_name: OAuthToken
  fields:
    - access_token: string (required)
    - refresh_token: string (optional)
    - expires_in: integer (required, seconds)
    - token_type: string, enum=[bearer], (required)
  source: specs/auth.md REQ-014
- type_name: VerificationCode
  fields:
    - email: string format=email (required)
    - code: string pattern=^[0-9]{6}$ (required)
    - expires_at: string format=date-time (required)
  source: specs/auth.md REQ-015
```

When a spec scenario references a type by name without describing its fields ("respond with a `User`"), check whether the type is already defined in `$BASELINE_DIR/schemas/`. If so, record the reference and skip — there is no new schema to author. If not, surface the gap as a `[unknown]` finding in the alignment report and (typically) halt; a downstream protocol skill cannot wire `$ref` to a non-existent file.

When the slice has **no specs** (rare for the author intent — usually a contract-only import slice), skip steps 2–4 and route to [`importer.md`](./importer.md) instead.

### Step 3 — Compute the minimal delta

Compare each spec-derived type from Step 2 against the baseline inventory from Step 1. Classify into one of three buckets:

#### Already covered

The baseline already defines a schema with a matching `$id` (or matching filename). Verify alignment:

- Property names, types, and formats from the spec are present in the baseline schema.
- Spec-required fields are in the baseline's `required` array.
- Sub-type `$ref` targets exist in the baseline (transitively).

If alignment fails, record a warning with `{ baseline_file, spec_requirement_id, discrepancy }` for the alignment report. **Do not regenerate covered schemas** and **do not overwrite the baseline** — flag the mismatch and let a human resolve it (typically by either updating the spec or by introducing a new schema with a fresh `$id` and a deprecation note on the old one).

#### New or modified

The spec describes a type absent from the baseline, or asserts new fields on an existing baseline type. Add to the schema delta:

- New top-level types: write a new file under `$SCHEMAS_DIR/<kebab-name>.yaml`.
- New optional fields on an existing baseline type: produce a delta file that copies the baseline schema verbatim plus the new property; surface the slice as a compatibility note (additive optional fields are backwards-compatible).
- New required fields on an existing baseline type: produce the delta file but flag the slice as a backwards-incompatible warning — every consumer of the baseline schema will need to update.
- Type narrowing on an existing field (tighter `pattern`, narrower `enum`, lower `maximum`, etc.): also flag as a warning.

#### Normalisation

The baseline file lacks Emery-required metadata (`$id`, `$schema`, `title`, `description`). Propose a normalisation delta that adds the metadata without changing the schema's shape (no property additions, no required-set changes). Surface as a separate section in the alignment report.

### Step 4 — Generate or update schema files

For every type in the delta, write a file under `$SCHEMAS_DIR/<kebab-name>.yaml`. Apply the conventions in [`../../references/json-schema-conventions.md`](../../references/json-schema-conventions.md) verbatim; the rules below are the operationally-critical ones for the author path.

Required structure:

```yaml
$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
$id: "urn:emery:schemas/<filename-without-extension>"
title: <PascalCaseTypeName>
description: <one-sentence behavioural description from the spec>
type: object
properties:
  <snake_case_field>:
    type: <json-schema-type>
    description: <one-sentence purpose from the spec>
required:
  - <field>
additionalProperties: false
```

Then verify each generated file against the rules below.

## `$id` assignment policy

Every schema file declares a `$id` field. The format is non-negotiable:

```yaml
$id: "urn:emery:schemas/<filename-without-extension>"
```

Rules:

- **Prefix.** Always `urn:emery:`. Never `https://` or `file://`. The URN format is RFC 8141-compliant and works with `ajv`, `typify`, and `json-schema-ref-parser` without requiring a base URL.
- **Path segment.** Always `schemas/<kebab-name>` — the file's path under `contracts/` minus the `.yaml` extension. A schema at `contracts/schemas/user-registration.yaml` gets `$id: "urn:emery:schemas/user-registration"`.
- **Stability.** Once a schema is in the baseline, its `$id` is frozen. Renaming the conceptual type requires a new file with a new `$id`; never rewrite the existing `$id` in place. Surface a deprecation note on the old schema if needed.
- **Uniqueness.** Each `$id` is unique across the contract tree. The file-path derivation guarantees this when the one-type-per-file rule is honoured. The verifier flags duplicates.
- **No URLs.** Even though JSON Schema permits HTTP `$id` values, do not use them. URN form is the platform standard, ensures resolver-portability, and prevents accidental coupling to a domain.
- **No fragment suffixes.** `$id` values never carry `#` fragments. File-local sub-types use `$defs` with `$ref: "#/$defs/<name>"` inside the same file.

## One-type-per-file decomposition

Each schema file holds exactly one named, top-level type. This rule is enforced by both the author and the verifier.

When a spec scenario describes a payload that contains nested object shapes:

| Sub-shape usage | Decomposition |
|---|---|
| Used only inside one parent payload, no other consumer | Inline as `type: object` under `properties.<field>`, or use `$defs` if the structure recurs inside the same parent file |
| Used in two or more parent schemas | Extract to its own file `<sub-type>.yaml` and `$ref` from each parent |
| Already exists in `$BASELINE_DIR/schemas/` with a matching shape | Drop the inline definition; replace with `$ref: "<baseline-file>.yaml"` (relative path resolves either to change-local or baseline scope per [`../../references/artifact-structure.md`](../../references/artifact-structure.md)) |

The author's job is to predict reuse: when in doubt, extract. A file-local `$defs` entry can later be promoted to its own file without breaking consumers (the `$ref` rewrite is mechanical), but a wrongly-inlined shape that other schemas need is harder to refactor across an in-flight slice.

## Schema-file naming policy

Filenames are kebab-case and mirror the PascalCase type name in `title`:

| Type name (PascalCase) | Filename (kebab-case) | `$id` URN segment |
|---|---|---|
| `UserRegistration` | `user-registration.yaml` | `urn:emery:schemas/user-registration` |
| `OAuthToken` | `oauth-token.yaml` | `urn:emery:schemas/oauth-token` |
| `OrderPlaced` | `order-placed.yaml` | `urn:emery:schemas/order-placed` |
| `ErrorResponse` | `error-response.yaml` | `urn:emery:schemas/error-response` |
| `IPAddress` | `ip-address.yaml` | `urn:emery:schemas/ip-address` |

Acronym handling: collapse runs of capital letters into a single kebab segment (`OAuthToken` → `oauth-token`, `IPAddress` → `ip-address`). The `title` keeps the canonical PascalCase form (`OAuthToken`, `IPAddress`).

Naming guidance:

- **Domain-first**, transport-agnostic. `order-placed.yaml`, not `post-order-body.yaml` or `order-placed-event.yaml`. The same schema may appear as both an HTTP response body and an AsyncAPI message payload.
- **Singular by default** for entity types (`user.yaml`), plural only when the type itself is a collection wrapper (`order-list.yaml` for a paginated list type).
- **Suffix conventions** for narrow categories: `-request` / `-response` only when the schema is shape-specific to one direction and would otherwise collide with the entity name (e.g. `user-create-request.yaml` if the create payload differs from `user.yaml`).

## Vocabulary for shared payloads

Every schema file declares the metadata fields below. The vocabulary is fixed; do not invent new top-level keys.

| Field | Required? | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `$schema` | required | Always `"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"`. |
| `$id` | required | URN derived from the file path (see §`$id` assignment policy). |
| `title` | required | PascalCase type name matching the domain concept. |
| `description` | required | One-sentence behavioural description sourced from the spec. Describes *what the type represents*, not *how it is used*. Never `[imported — description pending review]` from the author path (that placeholder is reserved for the importer). |
| `type` | required | The JSON Schema type — almost always `object`. Primitive top-level schemas are rare; prefer wrapping primitives in objects unless the spec explicitly defines a scalar vocabulary. |
| `properties` | required for `type: object` | Map of `snake_case` field names to type definitions. |
| `required` | required for `type: object` | Array listing every field the spec mandates. Empty arrays are allowed but discouraged — most payloads have at least one mandatory field. |
| `additionalProperties` | required for `type: object` | Default to `false` (closed schema). Use `true` only when the spec explicitly allows arbitrary extension keys (rare; usually a smell). |
| `$defs` | optional | File-local sub-type map. Use only for shapes that are not reused across files. |

Optional vocabulary (use when the spec justifies it):

- `enum` — for fields with a known closed set of values.
- `pattern` — for regex-constrained strings.
- `format` — for known string formats (`date-time`, `email`, `uri`, `uuid`, `binary`).
- `minimum`, `maximum`, `exclusiveMinimum`, `exclusiveMaximum` — for numeric ranges. In Draft 2020-12, exclusive bounds are numeric values, never booleans.
- `minLength`, `maxLength` — for string length constraints.
- `minItems`, `maxItems`, `uniqueItems` — for array constraints.

## Spec → schema mapping rules

Map spec-scenario data to JSON Schema types using the table from [`../../references/json-schema-conventions.md`](../../references/json-schema-conventions.md). The most-used cases:

| Spec concept | JSON Schema | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Text / names / identifiers | `type: string` | Add `minLength` / `maxLength` if the spec constrains length |
| Email | `type: string`, `format: email` | — |
| URL / URI | `type: string`, `format: uri` | — |
| Date (no time) | `type: string`, `format: date` | ISO 8601 date |
| Timestamp | `type: string`, `format: date-time` | ISO 8601 datetime, UTC preferred |
| UUID | `type: string`, `format: uuid` | — |
| Integer | `type: integer` | Add `minimum` / `maximum` for ranges |
| Decimal / money | `type: number` or string-encoded depending on precision needs | Spec dictates |
| Boolean | `type: boolean` | — |
| Closed value set | `type: string`, `enum: [...]` | Status codes, categories, roles |
| Ordered collection | `type: array`, `items: { ... }` | Emery `minItems` / `maxItems` if the spec constrains cardinality |
| Nested object (reused) | `$ref: "<other-file>.yaml"` | Extract per the decomposition rules above |
| Nested object (file-local) | `type: object` inline, or `$defs` entry | — |
| Optional field | omit from `required` array | Do not use `type: ["string", "null"]` unless the spec distinguishes "absent" from "null" |
| Binary content | `type: string`, `format: binary` | For base64 in JSON; large blobs go through Blobstore (see `design.md`) |

Property naming: **always `snake_case`** in JSON Schema (`display_name`, `created_at`, `order_id`). This aligns with Rust struct field conventions and avoids serde `rename_all` in generated code. When a spec uses camelCase, the schema still uses snake_case; serde attributes handle wire-format conversion in generated types.

## Alignment report

Every author run produces an alignment report alongside the delta files. The report is the primary output for the contracts adapter build prompt — the YAML files are the artefact, but the report is how the build decides whether the slice can proceed.

```markdown
## Alignment Report (Schemas)

### Coverage
- **Covered by baseline:** N types (M with alignment warnings)
- **New (delta produced):** N types
- **Normalisation:** N files updated with metadata

### Alignment Warnings
- `User`: spec scenario REQ-003 asserts `verified_at` field; baseline schema does not define it
- `OAuthToken`: spec defines `expires_in` as `integer`; baseline defines as `string`

### Generated Delta
- `contracts/schemas/oauth-token.yaml` (new)
- `contracts/schemas/verification-code.yaml` (new)
- `contracts/schemas/user.yaml` (updated — added optional `verified_at`)

### Backwards-compatibility flags
- `user.yaml` — added optional field `verified_at` (additive; no consumer impact)
- `error-response.yaml` — narrowed `code` enum (potential consumer impact; verify each baseline binding that references this schema)

### Normalisation
- `pagination.yaml` — added missing `description`
```

After producing the report, run [`verifier.md`](./verifier.md) in `single` mode against `$SLICE_DIR` to confirm `$ref` resolution, metadata completeness, duplicate-`$id` checks, and cross-format consumer compatibility before declaring the artefacts ready.

## Edge cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|---|---|
| Spec describes a payload without listing all fields | Author the known fields; mark unknowns with a `description: "[unknown] — not specified in current scenarios"` line on a placeholder property and surface in the alignment report. Never invent fields. |
| Spec defines a wrapper type (e.g. paginated list) | Extract the wrapper to its own schema (`paginated-list.yaml` or domain-specific `order-list.yaml`); use `items: { $ref: ... }` to reference the element type. |
| Two specs reference the same type with conflicting shapes | Surface the conflict as a warning; do not write a delta until the specs are reconciled. |
| Existing baseline schema lacks `$id` (legacy import) | Author a normalisation delta that adds `$id` derived from the filename, without changing the property shape. Surface as a `Normalisation` finding. |
| Spec asserts a field shape that contradicts the baseline | Two valid resolutions: (a) extend the baseline schema (additive), or (b) introduce a new schema with a fresh `$id`. The author surfaces both options in the alignment report and lets the operator pick. |
| Circular `$ref` between schemas | JSON Schema permits circular references but they complicate codegen. Author the circle correctly and flag it in the alignment report as a code-generation consideration. |

## Verification checklist

Before declaring the author run complete:

- [ ] Every spec-derived type maps to a schema in either the baseline or the delta.
- [ ] Every delta file has `$schema`, `$id`, `title`, `description`, `type`, `properties` (when `type: object`), `required`, and `additionalProperties`.
- [ ] Each filename, `$id`, and `title` form a coherent triple per the naming policy.
- [ ] One named type per file; shared sub-types are extracted; file-local sub-types use `$defs`.
- [ ] Property names are `snake_case`.
- [ ] No invented fields; every property traces back to a spec scenario or a baseline schema.
- [ ] Alignment report enumerates coverage, warnings, generated delta files, backwards-compatibility flags, and normalisation entries.
- [ ] [`verifier.md`](./verifier.md) (single mode) ran clean against `$SLICE_DIR`.
