# Android-Writer Rules and Important Notes

**When to read this**: open this file at the start of every Android shell run, and again before final verification (step U8). It captures the Update Mode preservation contract plus the normative facts about the platform — UniFFI bridging, generated-type packages, Java 21 pinning, network security config, defensive error handling, and the crash-recovery pattern — that are easy to violate by hand-editing the rendered scaffold.

## Scaffold immutability (create and update mode)

1. **Keep DX aligned with `$TEMPLATE_DIR`.** `Android/Makefile`, `Android/settings.gradle.kts`, `Android/build.gradle.kts`, `Android/app/build.gradle.kts`, and `Android/shared/build.gradle.kts` come from the local `vectis-template` checkout after identity substitution. On drift, re-copy from `$TEMPLATE_DIR` — agents must not invent pins during verify-repair or feature work.
2. **Host NDK substitution is Makefile-owned, not agent-authored.** `make setup-host` may replace `__ANDROID_NDK_VERSION__` in `Android/shared/build.gradle.kts`; sync preserves an already-substituted NDK pin when comparing bytes.

## Preservation Rules (Update Mode)

1. **Never regenerate a file from scratch.** Make targeted edits.
2. **Preserve custom styling** that the developer added beyond the Material 3 defaults.
3. **Preserve custom composable logic** (e.g., animations, gestures) that is not driven by the ViewModel.
4. **Preserve `@Preview` blocks** on unchanged composables.
5. **Preserve Gradle customizations** (signing, flavors, custom build phases).
6. **Preserve `Makefile` customizations** (additional targets, environment variables).

## Important Notes

- **Core must exist first**: This skill generates the Android shell for an existing Crux core. Run the core-writer skill first to generate the `shared` crate.
- **Shell is thin**: All business logic lives in the Rust core. The shell only renders composables and performs platform I/O. Never add business logic to Kotlin code.
- **UniFFI bridging**: The shared crate must have `crate-type = ["cdylib", "staticlib", "lib"]` and the `uniffi` feature gate. The `uniffi` crate must match the active Vectis version pins (and therefore the `crux_core` bundled bindgen). Run `make verify` (or `make build` then `./gradlew :shared:cargoBuild` and `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`) to detect mismatches.
- **UniFFI library name**: Cargo produces `libshared.so` but JNA expects `libuniffi_shared.so` by default. The Application class MUST set `System.setProperty("uniffi.component.shared.libraryOverride", "shared")` before any UniFFI class is loaded. Without this, the app crashes on launch.
- **Generated types live in `com.example.app`**: The codegen binary produces Kotlin types (via facet) in `com.example.app.*` and UniFFI bindings in `uniffi.shared.*`. These live in the `generated/` directory, which is included as a source directory in the `shared` Gradle module. Hand-written Kotlin in `com.vectis.{appname}` MUST import them explicitly. This is the most common source of "Unresolved reference" compile errors.
- **rust-android-gradle**: Mozilla's plugin cross-compiles the Rust crate into `libshared.so` for 4 ABIs (arm, arm64, x86, x86_64). It requires Python 3. If Python 3.13+ causes issues with the `pipes` module, use Python 3.12.
- **Two Core patterns**: Simple apps (Render-only) use `Core` extending `ViewModel` with `mutableStateOf`. Complex apps (with HTTP/SSE) use a plain class with `StateFlow` injected via Koin. Both patterns require an Application class for the UniFFI library override, which the scaffold always emits as `{AppName}Application.kt`.
- **Gradle wrapper is required**: The `gradlew` script must exist before any `./gradlew` command works. It lands from `$TEMPLATE_DIR` at materialize time — do not invent a wrapper pin. Host-specific `local.properties`, Java 21 (`org.gradle.java.home`), and NDK substitution run via `make setup-host` in the Android shell Makefile.
- **Java 21 LTS required**: Java 25+ has a version string that Gradle's Kotlin compiler cannot parse. `make setup-host` derives Java 21 (for example, `/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21` on macOS) and appends `org.gradle.java.home=<path>` to `gradle.properties` when missing. When no Java 21 is installed, report the prerequisite blocker.
- **Network security config**: Android 9+ blocks cleartext HTTP traffic by default. Apps with HTTP or SSE effects MUST include a `network_security_config.xml` to allow cleartext to localhost/`10.0.2.2` for development. Without it, the app crashes on first network request.
- **Defensive error handling**: CoreFFI calls (`coreFfi.update()`, `coreFfi.view()`, `coreFfi.resolve()`) throw `CoreException` with a meaningful Rust-side error message. Always use `try/catch` with `Log.e(TAG, "context: ${e.message}", e)` so the diagnostic is visible in logcat. Bincode calls use `try/catch` with `Log.w` and a safe fallback. The `Effect.Render` handler must preserve the existing view on failure -- never fall back to `ViewModel.Loading`. All async effect handlers (SSE, Time) that run in `scope.launch` blocks MUST wrap their bodies in `try/catch` to prevent unhandled exceptions from crashing the app. Always rethrow `CancellationException`.
- **themes.xml is mandatory**: `AndroidManifest.xml` references a theme resource. The `res/values/themes.xml` file MUST exist or the build fails with `resource style/Theme.{AppName} not found`.
- **No Android Studio required for builds**: The Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`) handles compilation. The emulator can be launched from the command line. Android Studio is only needed for initial SDK/NDK installation or for the visual layout editor.
- **Hot reloading**: Jetpack Compose's built-in Live Edit and `@Preview` composables provide the development-time iteration equivalent of iOS's Inject/InjectionIII. No additional library integration is needed -- Live Edit is available in Android Studio and updates composables on save. Every screen composable should include a `@Preview` with sample data (checked by AND-008) to enable visual preview without running the emulator.
- **Crash recovery handler**: The Application class should install a global uncaught exception handler that persists crash info and restarts the Activity instead of letting the app terminate. This is especially effective for Crux apps because the core manages state -- restarting the Activity re-creates the Core and re-renders the current ViewModel. See references/crux-android-shell-pattern.md for the full pattern.
- **Emery integration**: When `slice-dir` is provided, the skill reads the `## Android Shell Requirements` section from the feature spec and the `## Android Shell Details` section from design.md. The primary input remains `app.rs` from the core; the feature spec's platform section supplements with requirements that may not be expressed in the Rust types alone (e.g., navigation style, specific UX behaviors, accessibility requirements, layout constraints).
