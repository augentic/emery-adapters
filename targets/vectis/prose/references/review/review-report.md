# Review report template

Output format for the review synthesis step. The review is one engine-dispatched pass: report every finding the team confirmed in this pass — the engine owns any repair routing and re-review dispatch, so never number passes or carry findings over from earlier reports.

## Code Review Report: {app-name}

**Review Team**: 3 specialists + 1 antagonist
**Confidence Level**: [high | medium | low]

### Summary
- critical: N findings
- important: N findings
- suggestion: N findings
- optional: N findings

### Critical findings

#### [CRX-001-1] Missing render() after page transition
- **rule_id**: VECTIS-002
- **File**: shared/src/app.rs, lines 384-388
- **Reviewer**: Structural Specialist
- **Antagonist**: Confirmed
- **Issue**: Navigating from Error to Loading mutates `model.page` without
  emitting `render()`. The shell may not see the Loading state.
- **Fix**: Wrap the return in `render().and(Command::event(Event::Initialize))`

Classify each finding as **mechanical** (safe for a bounded fix) or **design-level** (requires architectural decisions). The classification is metadata for the engine-dispatched `repair(origin: review)` pass — review itself applies nothing.

## Finding-ID conventions

- Occurrence prefixes (`CRX-1`, `LOG-1`, `IOS-1`, `AND-1`, `SWF-1`, `KTL-1`, `INT-1`, `GEN-1`, `UNI-1`, `NEW-1`) are **report-local** counters — the `id` field on a structured `Diagnostic` (the `Diagnostic` schema uses the equivalent `FIND-0001` shape; this report uses prefixed counters for human triage). They restart in each report and must not be confused with codex `rule-id`s.
- Codex citations carry a separate `rule_id` field (markdown prose) that maps to the kebab-case `rule-id` field on the `Diagnostic` wire shape. Vectis codex ids match `^VECTIS-[0-9]{3}$` (e.g. `VECTIS-001`, `VECTIS-101`, `VECTIS-201`); shared ids match `^UNI-[0-9]{3}$`. Leave the field out for genuinely unmapped findings rather than inventing a rule id.
- Severity uses the closed `Diagnostic` severity enum: `critical`, `important`, `suggestion`, `optional`. Severity reflects antagonist adjustments — upgrades and downgrades rewrite the displayed severity but preserve the original prefix and occurrence id.
- Confidence uses the closed `Diagnostic` severity enum: `high`, `medium`, `low`. Required when `source: model-assisted`.
- Every finding carries a `file:line` reference and a verbatim code snippet.
