id: VECTIS-006
title: Asset Render-By-Kind
severity: important
trigger: A Vectis shell renders a composition-referenced asset id whose `assets.yaml` entry is `vector` or `raster` using a platform symbol instead of the materialized export.

## Rule

Shell writers resolve each composition `icon` / `image` / `icon-button` / `fab` reference through `assets.yaml` and emit view code strictly by entry `kind`:

| `assets.<id>.kind` | iOS | Android |
|---|---|---|
| `vector` | `Image("<id>")` from a shell-local imageset copied from the materialized export | `painterResource(R.drawable.<id_snake>)` from a shell-local drawable copied from the materialized export |
| `raster` | `Image("<id>")` from a shell-local imageset with per-density PNGs | `painterResource` from per-density drawables |
| `symbol` | `Image(systemName: symbols.ios)` — no catalog copy | `Icon(imageVector = Icons.Default.<glyph>, …)` — no resource copy |

**Forbidden:** emitting `Image(systemName:)` (iOS) or `Icons.Default.*` / Material Icons substitutes (Android) for an id whose entry is `vector` or `raster`. Missing platform exports are validation errors (`assets-materialization-missing`) — never a writer shortcut. Platform glyph use requires an explicit `kind: symbol` entry (optionally `inferred: true` when promoted from screenshot inference).

v1 enforcement is **review-scoped**: build reviewers cross-reference `composition.yaml`, the effective `assets.yaml`, committed `exports/<platform>/` trees, and shell UI sources. Mechanical `specify lint project` hints that join composition ids to shell symbol fallbacks remain deferred to a follow-on rule.

## Look For

- A composition-referenced asset id whose `assets.<id>.kind` is `vector` or `raster`, but the matching screen view uses `Image(systemName:)` (iOS) or `Icons.Default.*` / `material.icons.Icons.*` (Android) for that visual role instead of the catalog / drawable emission.
- Shell code that substitutes SF Symbols or Material Icons when `sources.<platform>` pins or default export paths exist for the id — the export tree is the authority, not platform glyph names.
- `Image(systemName:)` or `Icons.Default.*` used for an id that appears in `composition.yaml` even when the writer intended a one-off decorative glyph — only `kind: symbol` entries may use platform symbols at build time.
- Legitimate `kind: symbol` entries rendered correctly — do **not** flag `Image(systemName:)` when the referenced composition id resolves to `kind: symbol` in the effective `assets.yaml`.

## Spec Guidance

When screenshot inference or a writer shortcut produced a platform symbol for branded artwork, promote the asset to `vector` or `raster` in `assets.yaml`, let the adapter's materialize step populate the exports (it runs deterministically at build prepare), and regenerate the shell so the view copies the materialized export. When the glyph is genuinely platform-native chrome, add or retain a `kind: symbol` entry (with `symbols.ios` / `symbols.android`) and keep composition referencing that symbol id — do not leave a `vector` / `raster` entry in inventory while the shell still emits platform symbols.
