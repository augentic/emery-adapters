# Vectis target — build brief

`/spec:build` reads this brief when the active in-progress slice declares `target: vectis`. The brief drives the host workflow that produces a buildable cross-platform application (Crux shared core + per-platform shells) from the slice's already-synthesised `spec.md` and `design.md`. It owns three responsibilities the legacy skill-per-step layout did not pin down in one place:

1. **`composition.yaml` regeneration.** Synthesis does not write `composition.yaml`. This brief regenerates it from `spec.md` + `design.md` (which already carry every upstream spatial / structural claim synthesis folded in from source adapters) at the start of each build, alongside the code it accompanies. `merge` lands the regenerated file together with the implementation code.
2. **Inline phase sub-briefs.** Each build phase body lives in a phase sub-brief under [`build/`](build/).
3. **Design-system inputs.** `tokens.yaml` and `assets.yaml` are operator-curated and consumed as read-only build inputs; the brief never invents or restates their contents. The component catalog (`.specify/design-system/components.yaml`) is the third design-system input, joining `tokens.yaml` and `assets.yaml`, but it is **agent-inferred and operator-reviewable**, not operator-curated: `specify catalog infer --phase bind` writes it during Step 0.5 (binding the names the build skill or operator parts supply), and the brief reads the confirmed entries back during composition regeneration to factor shared component code per in-scope shell tree. Operators review and may `reject` or rename entries. When absent, no component factoring occurs.

The Vectis target stays three-capability (`shape` / `build` / `merge`) — there is **no** fourth `refine` slot. Composition regeneration is part of `build`.

## Inputs

The brief runs against the build request the CLI prepared at `.specify/slices/<slice>/build/request.yaml`; consume its `inputs` manifest rather than relying on convention. Every artifact path resolves against `inputs.root` (the slice tree).

- `inputs.artifacts.proposal` (`proposal.md`) — `## Platforms` scope (`core` / `ios` / `android`) and screen / interaction intent.
- `inputs.artifacts.specs[]` (`specs/<domain>/spec.md`) — behavioural requirements per domain: screen titles, scenarios, platform-specific behaviour, validation rules.
- `inputs.artifacts.design` (`design.md`) — domain model: ViewModel / `Event` / `Route` variants, per-page view structs, capability matrix.
- `inputs.artifacts.tasks` (`tasks.md`) — phase-completion tracking.
- `inputs.artifacts.additional[]` — the three design-system inputs declared by [`adapter.yaml`](../adapter.yaml), **all optional** (`required: false`), each with an explicit absent-fallback:
  - `tokens.yaml` — design tokens; absent → HIG (iOS) / Material 3 (Android) theme fallback in the shell writers.
  - `assets.yaml` — asset inventory; the composition validator's `tokens` / `assets` modes run only when the respective file is present.
  - `components.yaml` — the agent-inferred component catalog (surfaced as `CATALOG_PATH`); written by `specify catalog infer` at Step 0.5 and read back during composition regeneration; absent → no component factoring.

## Standard arguments

All phase sub-briefs assume these symbols are resolved by `/spec:build` before the sub-agent fan-out:

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `SLICE_ID` | The active slice name (`specify plan next` output, or `specify slice` argument). |
| `SLICE_DIR` | `.specify/slices/<SLICE_ID>/`. |
| `DOMAIN_NAME` | The single domain spec folder under `SLICE_DIR/specs/`. When the slice carries multiple domains, iterate the per-domain phase sub-briefs in declaration order. |
| `PROJECT_DIR` | The target project root (single-repo mode) or the resolved workspace slot (workspace mode). |
| `IOS_SHELL_DIR` | `${PROJECT_DIR}/iOS` (only when `ios` is in scope). |
| `ANDROID_SHELL_DIR` | `${PROJECT_DIR}/Android` (only when `android` is in scope). |
| `APP_NAME` | The Xcode target / Swift source folder name (derived from `design.md`'s `App` struct name). |
| `CATALOG_PATH` | `${PROJECT_DIR}/.specify/design-system/components.yaml` when present. Optional — absent means no component factoring. |

## Platform scope

Every slice carries the full app platform set from `project.yaml.platforms` (stamped verbatim into `proposal.md ## Platforms` by synthesis). Each slice signifies core + all declared shell work; build determines the **actual per-platform work**:

- **create** — the shell tree is absent on disk → run `specify extension run vectis -- scaffold <platform> <APP_NAME> [--caps <csv>]` to stand up the minimum shell before generating into it. Standing up an absent shell is this adapter's own build-time responsibility — there is no separate plan-time bootstrap slice; `project.yaml.platforms` already declares the intent. Only `core`, `ios`, and `android` have scaffold support today.
- **update** — the shell tree exists → diff core types against existing code and apply targeted edits (the normal feature-slice path).
- **no-op** — the platform is in scope but the slice introduces no changes for that shell (skip the sub-brief).

Valid Vectis platform tokens are `core`, `ios`, `android`, `web`, and `desktop`. Only `core`, `ios`, and `android` have build sub-briefs today; `web` and `desktop` in the platform set are silently skipped by the phase order (no sub-brief to load). Token / asset / layout work is **input context**, never a platform.

Process platforms in dependency order:

1. `core` first — shells depend on the core.
2. `ios` and `android` shells — independent of each other; their **generation** phases can run in parallel; their **verify** phases are serial because they share the same Cargo workspace lock.
3. `web`, `desktop` — deferred (no sub-brief; silently skipped).

If the platform set contains `core` only, skip the iOS and Android phase sub-briefs wholesale; this is a backend-only build.

## Phase order

**Step 0.5 — component inference (runs before the numbered phases, ahead of composition regeneration).** Component *identity* is deterministic and owned by the CLI (a structural fingerprint over each `group`'s normalized skeleton); component *identification and naming* are model judgement and owned by this brief. The CLI carries **no** component vocabulary — it reports identity + evidence and records the names it is handed; this brief decides what each clustered structure *is* and what to call it. Run inference before regenerating composition so the regeneration at [`build/composition.md`](build/composition.md) step 6 reads an up-to-date catalog. **Timing.** The report clusters against the **merged** baseline plus the candidate cache and `parts.yaml` — not the current slice's composition, which has not merged yet. With one screen per slice and the default `--min-occurrences 2`, a baseline-only path surfaces a repeated structure at the **third** slice's build (once two prior screens have merged); the screenshots candidate cache (RFC §B4) can supply the second occurrence **during** the second slice's build when stage-6 sidecars exist. B7 retroactive factoring runs on whichever build first binds the component.

1. **Report.** Run `specify catalog infer --phase report --format json` to obtain the deterministic, **name-free** cluster report against the current merged baseline (`${PROJECT_DIR}/.specify/specs/composition.yaml`). The verb folds the screenshots candidate cache and, when present, the operator-authored `parts.yaml` (`${PROJECT_DIR}/.specify/design-system/parts.yaml`) into the same clustering pass automatically — no extra flags. A `parts.yaml` part is a third authoritative input that carries two authorities the verb honours silently: **naming** (its operator slug wins, so the matching cluster arrives with `bound-slug` already populated — leave it untouched in step 2) and **promotion** (a part matching at least one baseline group is surfaced as a cluster even below the occurrence threshold). Parts that match no baseline group surface in the verb's non-blocking `part-unmatched` report (informational, in both the `report` output and the `--phase bind --dry-run` diff); it never gates the build and is only authoritative over the complete baseline at change completion. An absent baseline yields an empty report (nothing to name). Each reported cluster carries a `fingerprint` (the opaque identity), an `occurrences` count, the `screens` provenance list, the representative normalized `skeleton`, an `evidence` block (`region`, `item-kinds`, `event-targets`, and an optional `candidate-names` list of stage-6 suggestions), and a `bound-slug` (the name already bound to that fingerprint, or `null`).
2. **Identify and name by judgement.** For each reported cluster whose `bound-slug` is `null`, decide *what the component is* and *what to call it*: read its `evidence` and representative `skeleton`, and choose a kebab-case slug. There is **no fixed component vocabulary** — a repeated footer of navigation icons might be a `tab-bar`, a `rail`, or a novel navigation form this app invents; name it on its merits rather than forcing it into a known label. The `evidence.candidate-names` suggestions (when present) are non-authoritative stage-6 hints you MAY adopt or override — never an identity. A cluster whose `bound-slug` is **already populated** is already named — from a prior run's catalog binding, or from an operator `parts.yaml` pin whose name wins — so leave it untouched.
3. **Bind.** Write your `{ fingerprint → slug }` decisions to a small bindings file (e.g. `${SLICE_DIR}/build/component-bindings.yaml`) and run `specify catalog infer --phase bind --bindings <file>` to record them. The bindings file is a `bindings:` map keyed by each cluster's `fingerprint`, valued by the bare slug (or `{ slug, description }`):

```yaml
version: 1
bindings:
  <fingerprint-a>: tab-bar
  <fingerprint-b>:
    slug: detail-card
    description: "Repeated detail card across list rows."
```

   The CLI applies its deterministic guards — one skeleton per slug, never overwrite a `confirmed` / `rejected` entry, and stable fingerprint-derived suffixing (`slug-<fp-prefix>`) on a name collision — and is the **only** writer of `components.yaml`. Preview the catalog diff first with `--dry-run`. Skip this step when the report names no unbound clusters.
4. **Proceed.** Continue with the numbered phases below; composition regeneration (Phase 1) reads the updated catalog at [`build/composition.md`](build/composition.md) step 6 and attaches `component: <slug>` directives to every group whose skeleton matches a `confirmed` entry.

1. Load [`build/composition.md`](build/composition.md) — regenerate `composition.yaml` from `spec.md` + `design.md` and run the deterministic validator gate.
2. Load [`build/core/write.md`](build/core/write.md) — generate / update the Crux shared core.
3. Load [`build/test.md`](build/test.md) — generate / update Crux tests, then run the core verify-repair loop (max 3 iterations).
4. (When `ios` is in scope) Load [`build/ios/write.md`](build/ios/write.md) — generate / update the SwiftUI shell. After the writer sub-agent returns, run `specify extension run vectis -- sync ios-scaffold` once, then run the orchestrator-owned iOS verify loop from that brief (the orchestrator executes sync / swiftformat / make — repair sub-agents are Swift-only).
5. (When `android` is in scope) Load [`build/android/write.md`](build/android/write.md) — generate / update the Compose shell. After the writer sub-agent returns, run the orchestrator-owned Android verify loop from that brief (`make verify` — repair sub-agents are Kotlin-only).
6. Load [`build/core/review.md`](build/core/review.md) and, when in-scope, [`build/ios/review.md`](build/ios/review.md) and [`build/android/review.md`](build/android/review.md). Reviewers run in parallel.
7. Run § Consolidate review findings.
8. **Shell verify gate.** Run `specify extension run vectis -- verify --mode verify "${PROJECT_DIR}"`. A missing or empty tree for any supported declared platform (`core`, `ios`, `android`) forces `status: failure`. For `android`, the tool also checks the Gradle wrapper, `local.properties`, and the debug APK at `Android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` — compile assurance requires the android write verify sub-agent to have run `make verify` first; this gate is necessary but not sufficient on its own. `web` and `desktop` are valid tokens but have no on-disk interpretation yet — the tool emits a `platform-not-yet-supported` info finding and treats them as present.
9. Mark `tasks.md` checkboxes complete as each phase lands, then write the build report (§ Build report). The brief never transitions the slice — the CLI's `--phase finalize` validates the report and owns the `Refined → Built` transition.

## § Sub-agent delegation contract

Each writer / reviewer phase sub-brief runs in its **own sub-agent** with a clean context window. Core test verify-repair still runs inside its phase sub-agent. **iOS and Android shell verify are exceptions:** after each shell writer sub-agent returns, the orchestrator (not a verify sub-agent) runs that platform's verify shell commands; failures spawn platform repair sub-agents that may edit generated UI sources only. `/spec:build` coordinates the sequence and executes iOS and Android verify shell commands inline.

**Inputs (orchestrator → sub-agent):** `task` (one of `core-writer`, `test-writer`, `ios-writer`, `ios-verify-repair`, `android-writer`, `android-verify-repair`, `core-reviewer`, `ios-reviewer`, `android-reviewer`), `arguments` (standard arguments above), `mode` (`create`, `update`, or `repair` — decided by the orchestrator from on-disk inspection), `skip_verification` (true for shell writers; iOS and Android verify commands run from the orchestrator, not verify sub-agents), `artifact_paths` (paths to `spec.md`, `design.md`, `proposal.md`, regenerated `composition.yaml`, sibling `tokens.yaml` / `assets.yaml` when present, and `components.yaml` when `CATALOG_PATH` exists), `forbidden_paths` (`ios-verify-repair` only — `iOS/Makefile`, `iOS/project.yml`, `iOS/.vectis/sim-build.sh`), `allowed_paths` (`ios-verify-repair` only — Swift under `iOS/<APP_NAME>/`, plus `Theme/`, `Components/`, `Resources/`; `android-verify-repair` only — Kotlin under `Android/app/src/main/java/`), `orchestrated` (reviewer sub-agents only; signals that the reviewer is running inside a build phase so its `design_findings` should flow into § Consolidate review findings — reviewers always return `design_findings` for the parent to consolidate, never auto-spawn follow-up slices), `extra_context` (phase-specific: `error_output` for repair sub-agents, baseline test log for regression checks, prior phase warnings).

**Outputs (sub-agent → orchestrator):** `status` (`success` / `failure` / `pending`), `files_modified`, `verification` (inline result when the sub-agent ran one), `errors`, `warnings`, `design_findings` (reviewers only; empty list when nothing surfaced).

### Why verify is serial; review is parallel

The iOS verify pipeline (`make build` → cargo-swift) and the Android verify pipeline (`make verify` → typegen, `gradlew :shared:cargoBuild`, `gradlew :app:assembleDebug`) both invoke `cargo` against the same shared Rust workspace. Cargo uses a workspace-level lock file, so concurrent invocations serialise on the lock rather than running in parallel. The reviewers are pure code-analysis agent teams; they use different formatters (`swiftformat` vs Kotlin) and never invoke `cargo`, Gradle, or Xcode. With no shared mutable state and no build-tool contention, they are safe to run concurrently.

## § Consolidate review findings

When all in-scope reviews complete:

1. **Merge findings.** Combine `design_findings` from each reviewer into a single list. Deduplicate universal findings (UNI-prefixed) that both reviewers flagged with identical check IDs and matching evidence — keep the higher-severity instance. Platform-specific findings (CRX-, LOG-, GEN-, IOS-, SWF-, AND-, KTL-, INT-prefixed) are always distinct.
2. **Empty list.** Skip the rest of this section.
3. **Validate classifications.** Each finding already carries `code-fix` or `spec-change`. Treat that as the source of truth. Resolve disagreements between platforms by applying: spec is clear but code is wrong → `code-fix`; spec is silent, ambiguous, or problematic → `spec-change`.
4. **Surface findings.** Findings flow to the operator alongside the build outcome. Cross-platform follow-up work is queued as a new slice via the operator's normal `/spec:plan` flow rather than letting reviewers spawn slices directly.

## § Deterministic review

The per-platform reviewers above ([`build/core/review.md`](build/core/review.md), [`build/ios/review.md`](build/ios/review.md), [`build/android/review.md`](build/android/review.md)) carry the model-assisted surface — specialist + antagonist judgment per [`agent-teams.md`](../references/agent-teams.md). `specify lint project --format json` is the **deterministic complement**. It resolves applicable rules via `specify rules export`, evaluates declarative `rule_hints`, and emits findings in the same `LintFinding` shape (`rule-id`, `fingerprint`, severity, `evidence`) operators already see in that export. The two surfaces are layered, not alternatives — model-assisted judgment sits on top of the deterministic scan.

Vectis render-by-`kind` drift ([`VECTIS-006`](../rules/VECTIS-006-asset-render-by-kind.md)) is review-scoped in v1: iOS and Android Integration specialists run **IOS-020** / **AND-028** on the first full-scope iteration (see per-platform review briefs and team protocols). Mechanical cross-artifact hints are deferred until materialize export paths are stable in consumer projects.

Framework acceptance fixtures under `evals/fixtures/targets/vectis/` version-control `design-system/assets/exports/` (see [`task-list/design-system/`](../../../../evals/fixtures/targets/vectis/task-list/design-system/)) so build brief examples and eval pins demonstrate the materialize-then-copy hand-off without requiring image-processing deps in every CI job.

Per [Standards layer](../references/spec-runtime/standards-layer-snippet.md), deterministic findings may block CI but never transition plan entries, slices, or changes. CI wiring is consumer-project policy, not adapter policy; this brief acknowledges the surface and links out for the contract.

## § Template / version-pin drift handling

The Vectis scaffold tool (`specify extension run vectis -- scaffold ...`) is render-only and ships with embedded version pins. Upstream bumps (Crux core, uniffi, AGP / Gradle, cargo-swift, Xcode) can break a freshly rendered scaffold even when the rest of the slice is correct. Detect this when a verify-repair loop fails repeatedly with cargo / Gradle / Xcode errors that look like API renames, missing imports, or toolchain mismatches rather than feature-level bugs. When detected, do **not** auto-fix in-band: record the failing combo (caps + shells), the failing host step, and the load-bearing error line, then mark the build outcome as `deferred` with a template / pin drift signal. The operator opens a separate **specify-adapters** slice to edit [`extension/versions.toml`](../extension/versions.toml) and, if needed, [`extension/templates/core/`](../extension/templates/core/).

## § Phase outcome contract

> See [Phase outcome contract](../references/spec-runtime/phase-outcome-contract.md).

The `build` phase concludes with exactly one of `success` / `failure` / `deferred`:

- **success** — every in-scope verify-repair loop returned `success` within its iteration budget, the shell verify gate (step 8) passed, the orchestrator has both regenerated `composition.yaml` (or skipped it for a core-only slice) and the implementation code under `${PROJECT_DIR}`, and `outputs[]` is populated with each supported platform's artifact path (debug APK for `android`). Write a `status: success` build report (§ Build report); finalize owns the lifecycle transition.
- **failure** — any verify-repair loop exhausted its iterations, or the composition validation gate ([build/composition.md](build/composition.md)) failed and could not be repaired. Surface the load-bearing error line as `--summary` and the full output through `--context`, and write a `status: failure` build report with the blocking findings mapped where possible; the merge brief refuses to run while the slice is in this state.
- **deferred** — a host prerequisite is missing (Java 21, Android SDK, Rust Android targets, `cargo-swift`, Gradle wrapper, Xcode CLT) or a template / pin drift issue surfaced and operator judgement is required. Surface the unresolved prerequisite or drift signal as `--summary` and write a `status: failure` build report (the report carries only `success` / `failure`; `deferred` is the operator-facing stop signal, not a built slice).

## Build report

When the algorithm resolves, write a schema-valid build report to `.specify/slices/<slice>/build/report.yaml` (the handoff envelope's `report` field). This is the brief's final deliverable. The brief never transitions the slice lifecycle — the CLI's `--phase finalize` validates the report and owns the `Refined → Built` transition.

```yaml
version: 1
slice: <slice-name>     # matches the build request's `slice`
target: vectis@1.0.0       # this adapter at its manifest version
status: success         # or: failure
findings: []            # structured diagnostics; default []
ui-surface:             # optional; this slice's UI-surface signal (see below)
  screens: 3
outputs:                # per-platform build outputs; default []
  - platform: core
    path: shared/
  - platform: ios
    path: iOS/
  - platform: android
    path: Android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The optional `ui-surface: { screens: <N> }` field carries this slice's UI-surface signal: `<N>` is the count of screen-bearing requirements this slice introduces or modifies, taken from the brief's own `spec.md` screen-identification judgement (the same walk `build/composition.md` Step 1 performs) — **never** from `## Platforms`, which is an app-level constant stamped verbatim to every slice and never narrows per slice. `screens: 0` means "no UI surface" (the composition skip case). The CLI's `--phase finalize` compares this authored signal against the produced `composition.yaml` and emits non-blocking coherence warnings (`composition-unexpected-for-non-ui-slice` when `screens: 0` yet a non-empty composition was produced; `composition-empty-for-ui-slice` when `screens > 0` yet the composition is empty or absent). Omitting the field disables those warnings; set it on every slice so the self-consistency check is live.

The `outputs[]` array declares the per-platform build outputs produced by this build. Each entry carries a `platform` token and a `path` relative to `PROJECT_DIR`. The CLI's `--phase finalize` verifies every declared path exists and is non-empty on disk; a missing output triggers `target-build-output-missing` (exit 2). Populate `outputs[]` with an entry for each supported platform in `project.yaml.platforms` that the build produced or maintained work for. For `android`, declare the debug APK path produced by `make verify`, not merely the `Android/` tree. Omit entries for platforms with no on-disk interpretation (`web`, `desktop`).

**Success vs failure findings rule.** A `status: success` report carries an empty `findings[]` or only non-blocking findings (`suggestion` / `optional`); the CLI rejects a `success` report carrying any blocking (`critical` / `important`) finding. A `status: failure` report populates `findings[]` with the blocking violations the target can map from the composition validator gate and the per-platform verify-repair output, and leaves `findings: []` when no specifics are mappable.

- **Clean build** — composition regenerated and the validator gate ([build/composition.md](build/composition.md)) passed (or was skipped for a core-only slice), every in-scope verify-repair loop (core, iOS, Android) returned `success` within its budget, the core loop passed with zero compiler warnings (`RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings"` on `cargo check` / `cargo test` and `clippy -- -D warnings` per [build/test.md](build/test.md)), the shell verify gate passed with zero new inline lint suppressions (`vectis verify --mode verify` suppression scan; [`VECTIS-009`](../rules/VECTIS-009-lint-suppression-forbidden.md)), and § Consolidate review findings produced no blocking findings → `status: success`, `findings: []` (or only advisory `suggestion` / `optional` findings), `outputs[]` populated with each supported platform's artifact path.
- **Unresolved build** — a verify-repair loop exhausted its iterations, the composition validator gate failed unrepaired, or a host prerequisite / template / pin drift signal forced a `deferred` outcome → `status: failure` with blocking findings mapped where possible.

Each `findings[]` item validates against `schemas/diagnostics/diagnostic.schema.json` (the structured-diagnostic shape distributed with the CLI; required fields include `id`, `title`, `severity`, `source`, `artifact`, `evidence`, `impact`, `remediation`, `fingerprint`). Map vectis's composition-validator, cargo / Gradle / Xcode verify, and review findings into that shape, carrying detail under `evidence.kind: structured` with `target-adapter: vectis`.

## Notes for downstream phases

- **`composition.yaml` is a build output.** It lives at `${SLICE_DIR}/composition.yaml` after this brief succeeds; the merge brief lands it into the baseline alongside the code. Operator-curated `tokens.yaml` / `assets.yaml` are also read by `merge`; the merge brief re-runs `specify extension run vectis -- validate composition` against the merged baseline so cross-artifact regressions are caught even when the current slice only touched code.
- **Do not write `composition.yaml` into `.specify/specs/`.** That is `specify slice merge`'s job, atomically, alongside the spec / design deltas.
- **Operator-curated inputs.** `tokens.yaml` and `assets.yaml` updates accompany the slice when the operator edits them; the merge brief promotes those edits into `design-system/tokens.yaml` / `design-system/assets.yaml` (or slice-local equivalents) using the same delta merge path as the spec deltas. The component catalog (`CATALOG_PATH`) is project-level and not slice-local; it is read as-is at build time and does not participate in the merge delta path.
