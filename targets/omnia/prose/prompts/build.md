# Omnia target — build prompt

> The omnia adapter core inlines this document into the system prompt of every build leg — generation, standards review, capture replay, and the report — alongside the leg's own prompt under [`build/`](build/). Leg sequencing lives in the adapter core (`core/src/operations.rs`), not here: each leg's user prompt names the sections of this document to follow. Synthesis idioms (provider DI, WASM guardrails, error variants, validation placement) live in [`guidance.md`](guidance.md) and must already be reflected in the slice's `specs/<domain>/spec.md` + `design.md` before the build runs.

## Inputs and bindings

The build runs against the build request the CLI prepared at `.specify/slices/<slice>/build/request.yaml`; consume its `inputs` manifest rather than relying on convention. Every artifact path resolves against `inputs.root` (the slice tree).

- `inputs.artifacts.proposal` (`proposal.md`) — domain inventory and slice scope.
- `inputs.artifacts.specs[]` (`specs/<domain>/spec.md`) — behavioural requirements, one file per `proposal.md ## Domains` entry.
- `inputs.artifacts.design` (`design.md`) — domain model, provider DI, error variants, and WASM idioms (see [`guidance.md`](guidance.md)).
- `inputs.artifacts.tasks` (`tasks.md`) — implementation sequencing and progress tracking.
- `inputs.artifacts.additional[]` — empty for omnia: [`adapter.yaml`](../adapter.yaml) declares no extra slice-tree inputs. Omnia reads the project working tree's `Cargo.toml` directly for workspace context; that is not a slice-tree input.

These working names, bound from the request and the resolved crate, are used throughout:

```text
$SLICE_NAME    = active in-progress plan entry's slice name (from `specify plan next`)
$SLICE_DIR     = .specify/slices/$SLICE_NAME
$DOMAIN_NAME   = domain slug from proposal.md ## Domains (typically equals crate name for single-crate slices)
$SPEC_PATH     = $SLICE_DIR/specs/$DOMAIN_NAME/spec.md
$DESIGN_PATH   = $SLICE_DIR/design.md
$TASKS_PATH    = $SLICE_DIR/tasks.md
$CRATE_NAME    = $SLICE_NAME with kebab → snake (or the slice's plan-level `crate:` override)
$CRATE_PATH    = crates/$CRATE_NAME
$GUEST_PATH    = workspace root (single `src/lib.rs` exports HTTP / Messaging / WebSocket guests)
$REVIEW_OUTPUT = $CRATE_PATH/REVIEW.md
```

`$SLICE_NAME` arrives in each leg's user prompt, taken from the build request.

## Mode detection

Check whether `$CRATE_PATH/Cargo.toml` exists:

- **Missing** → **create mode**: generate the crate, tests, and (if `src/lib.rs` is absent at the guest root) guest scaffolding.
- **Present** → **update mode**: incremental change against the existing crate; guest wiring updates are folded into the crate-writer step (skip the guest phase).

## Leg map

The adapter core drives four legs in a fixed order — generation (crate writer, test writer, guest writer in create mode, then the § verify-repair loop), standards review ([`build/review.md`](build/review.md)), capture replay ([`build/replay.md`](build/replay.md), self-skipping when no `captures` source is bound), then the report leg (see `## Build report`). Within the generation leg, write the crate before the tests, mark `tasks.md` checkboxes complete as each task lands, and never transition the slice lifecycle — the deterministic in-guest report gate checks the report answer and the workflow guest owns the `Refined → Built` transition.

## § Verify-repair loop (max 3 iterations)

Run after both crate writer and test writer have completed. Each iteration runs the four checks below; if any fail, classify the failure, apply the targeted fix, and start a new iteration.

```bash
cd $CRATE_PATH && cargo fmt --check
cd $CRATE_PATH && cargo check
cd $CRATE_PATH && cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cd $CRATE_PATH && cargo test
```

If `cargo fmt --check` fails, run `cargo fmt` once. Formatting is mechanical; one pass suffices.

If `cargo check` or `cargo clippy` fails, re-enter [`build/crate.md`](build/crate.md) with the error output as context. Apply minimum-change repair discipline (see [`repair-patterns.md`](../references/repair-patterns.md)).

If `cargo test` fails, classify each failure:

| Failure signal | Classification | Fix action |
|---|---|---|
| Error in `tests/` paths, `MockProvider`, or `provider.rs` | Test issue | Re-enter [`build/test.md`](build/test.md) |
| Error in `src/` paths, missing trait impls in production | Code issue | Re-enter [`build/crate.md`](build/crate.md) |
| Assertion mismatch where *actual* matches spec | Test issue | Test expectation is stale |
| Assertion mismatch where *expected* matches spec | Code issue | Handler returns the wrong result |
| MockProvider missing a trait impl the handler now requires | Test issue | Update MockProvider |
| Unresolved import or missing crate in `Cargo.toml` | Workspace issue | Fix `Cargo.toml` paths or workspace member list directly |

**Repair discipline.** Minimum change only — fix the reported error and nothing else. Scope the diff to files and functions named in the error output. Group failures by classification and re-enter each writer prompt once with all same-class errors. Full repair recipes: [`repair-patterns.md`](../references/repair-patterns.md).

**Update-mode regression check.** Before iteration 1, record the baseline: `cd $CRATE_PATH && cargo test 2>&1 | tee /tmp/${SLICE_NAME}-${CRATE_NAME}-baseline.txt`. After each iteration, for each test that passed before and now fails: if the spec explicitly changes the asserted behaviour → expected behavioural change, re-enter test writer to align expectations; if the spec does not change the asserted behaviour → true regression, route the fix through the classification table.

Repeat until all four checks pass or 3 iterations exhausted. If still failing after 3 iterations: **STOP**. Write a `status: failure` build report (see `## Build report`) mapping the remaining failures as blocking findings, surface the stop hint below with full error output, and do not transition the slice — a failure report parks it for human review.

## § Stop hint contract

A build failure surfaces a stop hint as the body's final output — a single structured message the parent skill or the parent loop can act on without re-deriving context:

- `slice` — slice name from `specify plan next`.
- `phase` — `build`.
- `failing-task` — the `tasks.md` checkbox (or sub-step) that exited non-zero.
- `log-path` — absolute path to the captured stdout/stderr.
- `next-action` — typically `re-run /spec:build $SLICE after fix`.

Render the hint as the final visible output of the run, alongside the `status: failure` build report (see `## Build report`). Never call `specify slice transition` — the deterministic in-guest report gate checks the answer and the workflow guest owns the lifecycle, so the slice stays `refined` and the loop (or a re-invocation) re-enters cleanly.

## § Deterministic review

Phase 6 writes `$REVIEW_OUTPUT` (`REVIEW.md`) — that is the model-assisted surface: specialist + antagonist judgment per [`team-protocol-crate.md`](../references/team-protocol-crate.md) and [`build/review.md`](build/review.md). `specify lint project --format json` is the **deterministic complement**. It resolves applicable rules via `specify rules export`, evaluates declarative `rule_hints`, and emits findings in the same `LintFinding` shape (`rule-id`, `fingerprint`, severity, `evidence`) operators already see in that export. The two surfaces are layered, not alternatives — model-assisted judgment sits on top of the deterministic scan.

Per [Standards layer](../references/spec-runtime/standards-layer-snippet.md), deterministic findings may block CI but never transition plan entries, slices, or changes. CI wiring is consumer-project policy, not adapter policy; this prompt acknowledges the surface and links out for the contract.

## Build report

When the algorithm resolves, return a schema-valid build report as the answer to the build's report leg (the schema-gated report answer — no report file is written). This is the build's final deliverable. Never transition the slice lifecycle — the deterministic in-guest report gate checks the answer's coherence against the working tree and the workflow guest owns the `Refined → Built` transition.

```yaml
version: 1
slice: <slice-name>     # matches the build request's `slice`
target: omnia@1.0.0        # this adapter at its manifest version
status: success         # or: failure
findings: []            # structured diagnostics; default []
```

**Success vs failure findings rule.** A `status: success` report carries an empty `findings[]` or only non-blocking findings (`suggestion` / `optional`); the deterministic report gate downgrades a `success` report carrying any blocking (`critical` / `important`) finding to `failure`. A `status: failure` report populates `findings[]` with the blocking violations the target can map from the verify-repair output and `REVIEW.md`, and leaves `findings: []` when no specifics are mappable.

- **Clean build** — the verify-repair loop passes (`cargo fmt --check`, `cargo check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`), the code-review remediation cycle leaves no unresolved `critical` / `important` findings in `REVIEW.md`, and replay passes when a `captures` binding is present → `status: success`, `findings: []`.
- **Unresolved build** — the verify-repair budget is exhausted (3 iterations) or the review remediation cycle cannot clear its blocking findings → `status: failure` with blocking findings mapped where possible.

Each `findings[]` item validates against `schemas/diagnostics/diagnostic.schema.json` (the structured-diagnostic shape distributed with the CLI; required fields include `id`, `title`, `severity`, `source`, `artifact`, `evidence`, `impact`, `remediation`, `fingerprint`). Map omnia's verify-repair and `REVIEW.md` findings into that shape, carrying detail under `evidence.kind: structured` with `target-adapter: omnia`.
